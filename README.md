# YouQueue
ðŸŽµ Web app for queueing and voting on songs for an event playlist

Awarded Best Design at MLH Local Hack Day Hackathon 2018 at UC Irvine

## What it does
For the MLH Local Hack Day, my team and I created a project called YouQueue - A Hacker Music Helper. YouQueue is a web application used for events where users can enter the YouTube url of a song and the program will add it into the playlist queue. People can "vote up" or "vote down" songs in the queue and the songs will be ordered based on the voting. If a song gets enough down votes, it is removed from the queue.

## How we built it
Python, Django, jQuery, AJAX, YouTube Data API

## What I did
My contribution to YouQueue involves integrating the YouTube Data API into the website. Using the URL the user submits, I programmed YouQueue to send an HTTP request to the YouTube Data API and parsed the response from it so that the website can display relevant information for each song.

## Accomplishments that I am proud of
This 12-hour hackathon was the very first hackathon that I attended during college. Being my first hackathon, I had no idea what to expect, what to do in preparation, who to work with, and what to create. I walked in not knowing anyone and I walked out with new friends and new mentors. Being a second year during this project, I did not have any experience programming fully functional applications. At that point, I was still learning Python and about data structures. Because of this, I felt hindered in my capability of contributing something substantial. However, I was determined in making a significant impact in my very first hackathon project, so I decided to take on the task of something that I worked with previously - using APIs in Python. By integrating the YouTube Data API into the web app, I felt that I made a big contribution to YouQueue because it was a core part of the application. Walking out of the hackathon, I felt proud of my accomplishment and was even more excited about participating in future hackathons.
